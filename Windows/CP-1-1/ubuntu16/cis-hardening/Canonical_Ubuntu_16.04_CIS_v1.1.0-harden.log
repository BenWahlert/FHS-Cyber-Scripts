Depends: netbase, libc6 (>= 2.15), libstdc++6 (>= 4.1.1)
Description: basic telnet client
 The telnet command is used for interactive communication with another host
 using the TELNET protocol.
 .
 For the purpose of remote login, the present client executable should be
 depreciated in favour of an ssh-client, or in some cases with variants like
 telnet-ssl or Kerberized TELNET clients.  The most important reason is that
 this implementation exchanges user name and password in clear text.
 .
 On the other hand, the present program does satisfy common use cases of
 network diagnostics, like protocol testing of SMTP services, so it can
 become handy enough.

Description: reliable system and kernel logging daemon
 Rsyslog is a multi-threaded implementation of syslogd (a system utility
 providing support for message logging), with features that include:
  * reliable syslog over TCP, SSL/TLS and RELP
  * on-demand disk buffering
  * email alerting
  * writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)
  * permitted sender lists
  * filtering on any part of the syslog message
  * on-the-wire message compression
  * fine-grained output format control
  * failover to backup destinations
  * enterprise-class encrypted syslog relaying
 .
 It is the default syslogd on Debian systems.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.
